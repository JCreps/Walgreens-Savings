# Walgreens-Savings
Simple script to add savings to Walgreens accounts.


- I was tired of having to "clip" all the coupons manually on the Walgreens app and desktop site. So I made this basic script that does it for me. Unfortunately, Walgreens limits accounts to 200 coupons so trying to run the script when you hit the max will not work.

- If you have any questions or issues please let me know

Best,
Julio
